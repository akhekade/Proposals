## Contributing
- Fork the repository by clicking "Fork" in the top right.
- Add your XPRO to your fork of the repository. There is a template XPRO here.
- Submit a Pull Request to XinFin's XPRO repository.
- Your first PR should be a first draft of the final XPRO. It must meet the formatting criteria enforced by the build (largely, correct metadata in the header). An editor will manually review the first PR for a new XPRO and assign it a number before merging it. Make sure you include a discussions-to header with the URL to a discussion forum or open GitHub issue where people can discuss the XPRO as a whole.

If your XPRO requires images, the image files should be included in a subdirectory of the assets folder for that Proposal as follow: assets/XPRO-X (for XPRO X). When linking to an image in the XPRO, use relative links such as ../assets/XPRO-X/image.png.
